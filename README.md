# CalgaryUrbanForest-Martin

This project sought to quantify tree biodiversity and average diameter at breast height (DBH) in the urban forest across the city of Calgary.  The Shannon-Wiener biodiversity index was calculated for each community using the "vegan" package in R-Studio 4.3.1.  The average DBH was then calculated in excel for each community. This csv provides the calculated values for each community as well as the community code.
